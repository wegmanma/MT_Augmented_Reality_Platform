\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Augmented Reality - or AR – is the concept of projecting virtual objects into the real world. Phone screens, tablet computers, and specialized goggles render virtual objects over the camera image or display them on translucent screens. A form of Augmented Reality is a heads-up display, for example, in cars to project the current speed and navigation information to the windshield or in airplanes for comprehensive avionic information.\\
In contrast, Virtual Reality – or VR – limits itself to entirely virtual worlds, into which the user dives. While Virtual Reality is already readily available through off-the-shelf goggles, which lets users meet other people and play games in virtual worlds, Augmented Reality is mainly limited to smartphone applications. Currently, it lacks readily available and specialized hardware, other than niche products specialized for specific industries.\\
Augmented Reality faces numerous technical challenges. Projecting a virtual object – for example, a flowerpot – into the real world requires the system to recognize a table and find an unoccupied location. Apart from placing decoration or furniture, a pair of AR goggles could project helpful information into the air. A mechanic could have virtual schematics or instructions floating beside his work, while another virtual monitor displays a video phone call with the customer. Hand detection and gesture control would enable interaction with virtual objects. Another example could be pedestrian navigation, projecting arrows to the street. \\
AR goggles need to react in real-time to any motion of the user’s head. Any latency would break immersion as virtual objects lose the connection with their anchor point in the real world. A flowerpot would jump on the table, and arrows on the street would start to float and collide with walls. Fast and reliable motion tracking of the system itself is vital for avoiding visual glitches.
\section{Scope}
\label{sec:Scope}
This thesis focuses on close-to-hardware fundamentals and omits the implementation of end-user applications. Without solid motion tracking of the AR system, all the other parts of Augmented Reality fail. Developing specialized AR goggles is pointless without reliable motion tracking; this also falls out of the scope.
\section{Initial Situation}
\label{sec:Situation}
The most advanced hardware available today is the Microsoft HoloLens featuring four cameras for motion tracking, two IR cameras for Eye-tracking, a 1Megapixel ToF sensor for depth measurement, a 9-Axis IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer), and an additional camera for photos and recording videos. The Implementation of how these sensors are fused for generating a smooth experience is closed source.\\
Other than with the HoloLens, there exist numerous applications on Smartphones and Tablets running either Android, iOS, or iPadOS. Google ARCore implementation relies on Machine Vision and can benefit from – but does not require –  a ToF camera. ARCore detects objects, estimates their size, tracks objects, and finds flat surfaces. The analysis of light sources allows a virtual object to cast a realistic shadow. Apple’s counterpart is ARKit, which leverages machine learning hardware on their “Bionic” smartphone SoCs.\\
Next to these two, numerous open-source projects focus on specific DIY projects and enable AR capabilities in a web browser through JavaScript or focus on stereo vision. 
\section{Goals}
\label{sec:Goals}
The goals of the thesis are to set up an end-to-end pipeline from data recording over processing to rendering, involving a three-dimensional object which follows the motion of a camera. An off-the-shelf time-of-flight (ToF) camera delivers depth information from which the camera motion is estimated. A sensor fusion approach will combine the estimated camera motion with an IMU.
\section{Target audience}
\label{sec:Ziel}
This document is targeted at readers with a basic understanding of computer science and computer vision. Prior knowledge in linear algebra is beneficial.
